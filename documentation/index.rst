Welcome to the documentation for Aether!
========================================

Hello everyone! Welcome to the documentation for our lung code!

The first thing we need to do to get going using this code is to :doc:`build </building>` the aether library, then once we have built the library we can :doc:`run </running>` it.  Before you start to develop the code make sure you read the section on :doc:`testing </testing>`.  Lastly, before you ask to get your code merged make sure you have looked at the :doc:`modules <modules>` and :doc:`fortran styles <fortranstyles>` sections to ensure that you have followed the conventions for this codebase.

Thanks and enjoy!
